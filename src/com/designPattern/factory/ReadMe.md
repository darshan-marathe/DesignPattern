Factory design pattern in Java one of the core design pattern which is used heavily not only<br/>
in JDK but also in various Open Source framework such as Spring, Struts and Apache along with <br/> decorator design pattern in Java. Factory Design pattern is based on Encapsulation object oriented concept. Factory method is used to create different object from factory often refereed as Item and it encapsulate the creation code. So instead of having object creation code on client side we encapsulate inside Factory method in Java.
